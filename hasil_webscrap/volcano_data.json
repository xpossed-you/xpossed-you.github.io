The Batur stratovolcano has produced vents over much of the inner caldera, but a NE-SW fissure system has localized the Batur I, II, and III craters along the summit ridge. Recorded eruptions have been characterized by mild-to-moderate explosive activity sometimes accompanied by lava emission.

A large landslide deposit to the north may be associated with the origin of the caldera, although collapse may rather be due to a voluminous explosive eruption (Newhall and Dzurisin, 1988). Eruptions have included explosive activity and lahars, primarily from the summit crater."

Immediately west of the Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the historically active Kawah Ijen crater, which contains a nearly 1-km-wide, turquoise-colored, acid lake. Kawah Ijen is the site of a labor-intensive mining operation in which baskets of sulfur are hand-carried from the crater floor. Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of cones forms an E-W zone across the southern side of the caldera.

A cluster of summit lava domes cut by numerous craters has given the summit a very irregular profile. Satellitic cones and lava domes are also located low on the E, W, and SSW flanks. Eruptive activity has in general migrated in a clockwise direction around the summit vent complex. More than 30 eruptions have been recorded since 1000 CE. The ejection of water from the crater lake during the typically short but violent eruptions has created pyroclastic flows and lahars that have caused widespread fatalities and destruction. After more than 5,000 people were killed during an eruption in 1919, an engineering project to drain the crater lake lowered the surface by more than 50 m. The 1951 eruption deepened the crater by 70 m, leaving 50 million cubic meters of water after the damaged drainage tunnels were repaired. Following more than 200 deaths in the 1966 eruption, a new deeper tunnel was constructed, and the lake's volume before the 1990 eruption was only about 1 million cubic meters."

Collapse of an older edifice, perhaps in 416 or 535 CE, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of that volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently the Rakata, Danan, and Perbuwatan cones were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan, and left only a remnant of Rakata. This eruption caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former Danan and Perbuwatan cones. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.This volcano is located within the Ujung Kulon National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage property."

Growth of Old Merapi during the Pleistocene ended with major edifice collapse perhaps about 2,000 years ago, leaving a large arcuate scarp cutting the eroded older Batulawang volcano. Subsequent growth of the steep-sided Young Merapi edifice, its upper part unvegetated due to frequent activity, began SW of the earlier collapse scarp. Pyroclastic flows and lahars accompanying growth and collapse of the steep-sided active summit lava dome have devastated cultivated lands on the western-to-southern flanks and caused many fatalities."

Summit topography is complicated by the shifting of craters from NW to SE. Frequent 19th and 20th century eruptions were dominated by small-to-moderate explosions from the summit crater, with occasional lava flows and larger explosive eruptions accompanied by pyroclastic flows that have reached the lower flanks of the volcano.This volcano is located within the Bromo Tengger Semeru-Arjuno, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve  property."

Talagabodas, also spelled Telaga Bodas, is one of the older Quaternary volcanoes in an arcuate N-S trending volcano group east of the city of Garut and is built up of andesitic lavas and pyroclastics. Younger pyroclastics from Gunung Putri-Eweranda overlap the Talagabodas products in the north. The crater of Talagabodas has shifted 1.3 km north from the summit crater of Canar and contains a large sulfur-saturated lake.  Fumaroles, mud pots, and a warm spring are found around the lake, which has an elevated temperature. The age of the most recent eruption is not known. Changes in lake color occurred in 1913 and 1921, and expanded solfataric activity was reported in 1927. Suffocating gases have frequently killed animals that have wandered into the Pajagalan valley on the NE flank and the Kawah Saat geothermal area south of the crater lake. The Kawah Karaha fumaroles 9 km N are also part of the geothermal system (Tripp et al., 2002)."

Late-Pleistocene lava flows largely filled the early caldera, after which activity changed to dominantly explosive eruptions during the early Holocene. Tambora was the source of history's largest explosive eruption, in April 1815. Pyroclastic flows reached the sea on all sides of the peninsula, and heavy tephra fall devastated croplands, causing an estimated 60,000 fatalities.  The eruption of an estimated more than 150 km3of tephra formed a 6-km-wide, 1250-m-deep caldera and produced global climatic effects.  Minor lava domes and flows have been extruded on the caldera floor at Tambora during the 19th and 20th centuries."

The latest of these produced the Young Toba Tuff (YTT) about 74,000 years ago from vents at the NW and SE ends of present-day Lake Toba. The YTT represents the largest known Quaternary eruption, ejecting about 3,800 km3(dense rock equivalent) of ash that covered ~40 million km2to a depth greater than 5 mm, plus another 1,500 km3of pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits (Costa et al., 2014). Resurgent doming formed the massive Samosir Island and Uluan Peninsula structural blocks after the YTT eruption. Additional post-YTT eruptions include emplacement of a series of lava domes, growth of the solfatarically active Pusukbukit volcano on the south margin of the caldera, and formation of Tandukbenua volcano at the NW-most rim of the caldera. Lack of vegetation suggests that Tandukbenua may be only a few hundred years old (Chesner and Rose, 1991)."
